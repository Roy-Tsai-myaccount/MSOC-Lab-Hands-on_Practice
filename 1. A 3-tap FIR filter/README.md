# A 3-tap FIR filter

## Algorithm

1.y[n] = c1*x[n]+c2*x[n-1]+c3*x[n-2]

## SPEC

1.The inputs are 8-bit signed-int numbers. 
2.The outputs are 18-bit signed-int numbers.

## You need to finish

1.Behavior modeling using SystemC.
2.RTL simulation using verilog and EDA Tools.
3.Get the netlist file.
Much like UNIX pipes, this enables the creation of UNIX-like pipes: programs
that consume a directory can produce a new immutable directory and output that.


## Acknowledgments

I was inspired by looking at how many codebases
