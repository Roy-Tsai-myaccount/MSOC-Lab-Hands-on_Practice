# A 3-tap FIR filter

This is the first project I began with. Although the example seems to be very simple, it's still a good example to start with. The objective of this project is to know the basic cell-based IC design flow, from HLS to netlist.  

## Algorithm  

1.y[n] = c1*x[n] + c2*x[n-1] + c3*x[n-2]  

## SPEC  

1.The inputs are 8-bit signed-int numbers.   
2.The outputs are 18-bit signed-int numbers.  

## You need to finish

1.Behavior modeling using SystemC.  
2.RTL simulation using verilog and EDA Tools.  
3.Get the netlist file.  



## Acknowledgments

I was inspired by looking at how many codebases
